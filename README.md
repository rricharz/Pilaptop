Programs for the [Pilaptop from Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/pilaptop-cm3-plus-package-a.htm)


**pi-active**

pi-active runs in background and displays a moving bottom
row on the 5x5 LED matrix. It shows the actual usage of the
CPU. The more busy the Raspberry Pi is, the faster the
lights are moving. See readme.txt in the folder pi-active for
details. pi-active uses the bottom row of the led matrix, which
is even visible if the cover above the led matrix is in place.


I am planning to add further programs for the Pilaptop here.
